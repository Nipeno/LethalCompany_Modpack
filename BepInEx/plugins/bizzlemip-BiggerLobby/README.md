# BiggerLobby V2.0.4

V2.1.9 was rolled back due to issues w/ network object deserialization. Expect updates shortly.



## Roadmap

Add more sliders & kick buttons

## Change Log

Minor chat bugs fixed

Note, this version is cross compatible with version 2.0.3, so if you are already using 2.0.3, there is no need to updrade.
