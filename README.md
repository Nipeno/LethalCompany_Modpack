# Lethal Company Modpack
A modpack for the game Lethal Company that I made for my friends.  
It just includes a bunch of QOL features and make the game way harder.  
I've also adjusted the configs a bit to make the game feel better.

## Installation

### Using git

Right click Lethal Company in Steam > Installed Files > Browse...  
Right click anywhere in the folder > Open in Terminal > Paste following code and run
```
git clone https://github.com/Nipeno/LethalCompany_Modpack.git .
```

### Manually

Download the repository as a ZIP > Drag the included folder onto your desktop  
This folder should contain 4 files (BepInEx folder, winhttp.dll, README.md, doorstop_config.ini)  
Drag everything except the README.md into your games folder

Fuck you Tony  
Fuck you Tank
